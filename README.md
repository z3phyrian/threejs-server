# Three.js Server with Puppeteer

This is a Node.js project that renders a Three.js scene to an image and serves it via an Express.js API.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
   
---

### ** Test on a Fresh Clone**
To confirm everything works:
1. Clone your repository to a new location or machine.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `node server.js`.

If it works as expected, your setup is complete! ðŸŽ‰
